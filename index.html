    <h1>More Tags</h1>
    <p>
        There are two documents in this exercise to help you learn to format text using semantic markup. HTML is "semantic" and most tags communicate the meaning and/or structure of the content that they are marking up. For instance, the &lt;p&gt; or paragraph tag creates a paragraph of text. A paragraph is "a distinct section of a piece of writing, usually dealing with a single theme and indicated by a new line, indentation, or numbering." The browser indicates the paragraph element by causing it to display on its own lines, with new lines that separate it from the paragraphs above or below.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <p>
        There are lots of tags that mark up words or phrases in your paragraphs of text because they mean something special.
        Those tags don't disrupt the display of the paragraph or other text blocks, because they display inline: "in the flow of the text."
        Mark up the words/phrases in <a href="inline-tags.html">inline.tags.html</a> as appropriate using the following tags:
        <ul>
            <li><code>strong</code> (strong/important)</li>
            <li><code>em</code> (emphasis)</li>
            <li><code>cite</code> (citation: title of publication, film, artwork, etc)</li>
            <li><code>q</code> (in-line quotation)</li>
            <li><code>abbr</code> don't forget to use the <code>title</code> attribute (abbreviation or acronym)</li>
            <li><code>sup</code> (superscript)</li>
            <li><code>sub</code> (subscript)</li>
            <li><code>code</code> (code)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Copy and paste this html file: <a href="inline-tags.html">inline-tags.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Your Part 1 page should look like this when complete:
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="inline-content.png" target="_blank">
            <img src="inline-content.png" width="500px"/>
        </a>
    </p>

    <h2>Part 2</h2>
    <p>
        On the html page <a href="block-tags.html">block-tags.html</a>, you'll want to use the tags that create larger groupings of text.
        The paragraph tag is one such tag; it takes multiple sentences and groups them together to form a unit with a single theme.
        The paragraphs will already be in most of the page, but you'll have to put in a few yourself.
        The meaning of the text and the screenshot will help you decide where and what to put in the markup to create these groups.
        <ul>
            <li><code>p</code> (paragraph)</li>
            <li><code>blockquote</code> (blockquote; large amount of directly-quoted text. Remember to use the <code>cite</code> attribute)</li>
            <li><code>footer</code> (we haven't officially learned this, but see if you can do the proper citation of a blockquote with this element: the lecture notes give you an example.)</li>
            <li><code>address</code> (contact info appropriate for context of site)</li>
            <li><code>hr</code> (the screenshot will show you how different thematic content is grouped/separated)</li>
            <li><code>br</code> (this tag doesn't group text, but the screenshot will help you see where line breaks are needed within another element for proper visual formatting according to conventions)</li>
            <li><code>abbr</code> (this doesn't group text either, but mark up content where you see that it exists!)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
